      Afewerk Tekle (22 October 1932 â€“ 10 April 2012) was one of Ethiopia's most
      celebrated artists, particularly known for his paintings on African and
      Christian themes as well as his stained glass. Born in Ankober, in Shewa
      Province, to Feleketch Yamatawork and Tekle Mamo, Afewerk grew up under
      the Italian occupation during the Second World War. Following the war, in
      1947, Afewerk decided that he wanted to help rebuild Ethiopia and elected
      to travel to England to study mining engineering. <br /><br />
      Before departing, Afewerk, together with other students leaving to study
      overseas, was addressed by Emperor Haile Selassie. Afewerk recalls being
      told "you must work hard, and when you come back do not tell us what tall
      buildings you saw in Europe, or what wide streets they have, but make sure
      you return equipped with the skills and the mindset to rebuild Ethiopia".
